# DP-Plant-Watering-Project-Revised

This application is a work in progress. 

Currently, it is a command line program that will tell the user when to water their plant based on the plant type and the last time the plant was watered. 

Eveuntually, I'd like it to be a tracking and water management program for those who want to both keep track of their houseplants, and keep track of watering small microgreen farms. 

To date, I've created the database to keep track of the user's plants, and have created the model classes and interfaces to interact with that database.

Next steps: complete the concrete classes for database interaction
            research equipment/an API to implement auto watering based on soil dryness or water level in a self watering container
